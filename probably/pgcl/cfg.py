Control-Flow Graph
------------------

This module can build up *control-flow graphs* (CFGs) of pGCL programs and
*decompile* them back to programs again. The main purpose of this module is the
transformation of a program with arbitrarily nested loops into a program with
one big loop (:func:`program_one_big_loop`).


.. doctest::

    >>> from probably.pgcl.compiler import compile_pgcl
    >>> program = compile_pgcl("nat x; while (x <= 3) { while (x = 0) { x := x + 1; }; if (x = 0) { x := x + 1; x := x + 2; x := x + 3; } {} }")
    >>> graph = ControlFlowGraph.from_instructions(program.instructions)
    >>> graph.render_dot().source
    'digraph...'

You can see the control-flow graph for this program visualized using GraphViz
below. It was created with the :meth:`ControlFlowGraph.render_dot` method. See
its documentation for more information on how to visualize a control-flow graph.

    used elsewhere, but should be declared in the program already). For a CFG
    from a well-structured pGCL program, the result is basically one big loop.

    It is assumed all loop heads (see :class:`BlockType`) are properly
    annotated.

    How does it work? This function basically just replaces each jump to a loop
    header, and the program entry and exit with a trampoline
    (:func:`JumpTable.trampoline`).

    .. exec::

        from probably.pgcl.cfg import _write_docs_one_big_loop
        _write_docs_one_big_loop()

    Let's work through a (contrived) example. The program below uses two nested
    (but redundant) loops.

    .. code::

        bool x;
        while (x) {
            while (x) {
                { } [0.5] { x:= false }
            }
        }


    The resulting CFG is (from :meth:`ControlFlowGraph.from_instructions`):

    .. image:: _generated/cfg-one-big-loop1.svg
        :align: center
        :width: 500px

    After :meth:`one_big_loop`, we get a much more complicated diagram (see
    below). Now all loops go through the jump table basic blocks that branch on
    `pc`.

    .. image:: _generated/cfg-one-big-loop2.svg
        :align: center
        :width: 100%

    A subtlety can be found in the image above:  The first branch of the
    generated jump table points to the program end and its terminator has been
    flipped (:meth:`Terminator.flip()`) so that the `true` branch goes into the
    loop and  and the `false` branch exits it. We do this to exactly reproduce
    the shape of a generated `while` loop. Also note that the ``goto 5`` is
    unreachable. See :class:`JumpTable` documentation for more information.

    Unfortunately we cannot directly translate this control-flow graph back into
    a well-structured pGCL program. By "direct translation" I mean translation
    to a pGCL program while using each statement exactly once. Consider for
    example the ``pc := 1`` basic block. It is obviously needed before the big
    loop to enter the proper state, but it is also needed after the inner while
    loop exits to return back to the outer loop (``br (x) 2 7``).
    :func:`reduce_cfg_to_instrs` has extra functionality to handle this case and
    will appropriately duplicate some trampoline blocks.

def reduce_cfg_to_instrs(graph: ControlFlowGraph) -> List[Instr]:
    r"""
    Reduce a control-flow graph to a program (i.e. list of instructions). The
    given graph must have the same shape as one generated by
    :meth:`ControlFlowGraph.from_instructions`. This is the case for graphs
    transformed by :func:`one_big_loop`.

    .. rubric:: How Does It Work?

    Recreating a structured program from a control-flow graph is a frighteningly
    complex and not yet well studied problem. There is an ancient theorem called
    `Structured Program Theorem`_ that essentially states "flowcharts"
    (basically the class of control-flow graphs we care about) can be reduced to
    structured programs in a very simple way with pretty unreadable output.
    It is listed under "folk version of the theorem", generating a single while
    loop [1]_:

    .. code::

        pc = 1
        while pc > 0:
            if pc == 1:
                block1()
                pc := successor of block 1
            elif pc == 2:
                block2()
                pc := successor of block 2
            ...

    This was *not* done here. Instead, we use a slightly smarter algorithm that
    reconstructs hierarchical control structure using `Dominator trees`_. Let's
    define some terms.

    node :math:`d` dominates a node :math:`n`
        A node :math:`d` dominates a node :math:`n` if every path from the entry
        node of the control-flow graph to :math:`n` must go through `d`. A node
        :math:`d` *strictly* dominates a node :math:`n` if it dominates
        :math:`n` and :math:`n \neq d`.

    dominance frontier
        The dominance frontier of a node :math:`d` is the set of all nodes
        :math:`n` such that :math:`d` dominates an immediate predecessor of
        :math:`n`, but does not strictly dominate :math:`n`.

    region
        A region is defined by an *entry edge* and *exit edge*, where the entry
        edge dominates the exit edge, the exit edge post-dominates the entry
        edge, and any cycle that includes one also includes the other.

    For example, the basic block for the condition of an if statement dominates
    all blocks in its *true* and *false* branches. Blocks for successor
    statements to that conditional statement are also dominated. The same thing
    holds for a while loop. So for CFGs generated from structured programs (and
    specifically for those generated by
    :meth:`ControlFlowGraph.from_instructions`), it suffices to concatenate
    statements into a sequence as long as each statement dominates the next one.
    The set of basic blocks in such a sequence is called a *region*
    (:class:`_Region`, see also [fcd16]_).

    Fortunately, this implementation can be restricted to these
    program-generated CFGs and those modified by :func:`one_big_loop`. That
    means we can create regions without problems for *almost all* basic blocks.
    The only difficulty are generated trampoline blocks. We handle those
    separately in an ugly method (:func:`_join_regions`).

    .. rubric:: Restrictions and Generalizations

    It is not completely clear what the above restrictions on input CFGs mean
    formally. Ignoring trampoline blocks, the restrictions are more strict than
    just having CFGs *reducible* [2]_. On the other hand, a generalized
    algorithm is a hard task, particularly for CFGs with arbitrary `goto`. The
    *relooper* of *Emscripten* was an attempt in a production JS-to-LLVM
    compiler [zak11]_. Iozzelli has revisited the problem for the *Cheerp*
    compiler using a dominator tree-based approach [ioz19]_. In their article,
    some ideas implemented here are discovered independently (e.g. our
    :class:`JumpTable` under the name "dispatcher"). Their general algorithms
    may be of interest for an improvement of this method [3]_ at the cost of a
    much more complex implementation, although the current one hopefully
    suffices.
